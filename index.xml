      <description>This site is built on Hugo which is really fast and easy to work with - even if you are only a basic developer. Here is how I setup my Hugo deployments. It&amp;rsquo;s actually really simple and it will help you save a lot of time updating your site.
Setup vscode to play nicely with Hugo These will help you to see your syntax and build your site from vscode directly using the command pallete.</description>

      <description>In consumer tech products, the holy grail is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;killer app.&amp;rdquo; Of course, in this phrase &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; means that an app will break the mold and have hockey-stick levels of adoption and user activity. This leads many to ponder the question&amp;hellip;
What is the formula for a killer app? Well, there is a man who wrote a formula. I am grateful to have spent some time with Eyal Herzog over the past two years.</description>

      <description>Thank you for visiting. This is my first post. I belive that we should always begin new things with gratitude.
I am grateful for all of the various experiences I have had and the many apps and projects I have worked on since 2013. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe the project list here covers only 7 years!
I am grateful for this site and domain which my dear friend Crystal Rose inspired me to put together.</description>

      <description>Curiousity is an art form itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a very curious person. I love to learn about people and I love to learn new tricks. My main interests are: internet philosophy, blockchain, building consumer apps, linux \ web security, air quality, dogs, chess, and astrology.
Before going full-force into building products in 2017, I ran a technology consulting company that I started back in college. The consulting company took me on many adventures and introduced me to many great people - it&amp;rsquo;s still profitable and being run by my business partner today!</description>

      <description>This is a list of the major projects I have worked on since 2013. Until Sense Chat, all of my projects were 100% self-funded.
 2019 - Sense (EOS) Chat  I joined as the CTO of Sense Chat - a decentralized messaging app built on the EOS blockchain. The beta app is live on the Google Play and Apple App Store.
EOS Chat leverages blockchain for accounts, authentication, encryption, and allows users to send tokens to one another with no middle man.</description>

      <description>This is a list of resources that I find useful / interesting.
 Defend Freedom Online  JP Barlow is one of the internet&amp;rsquo;s greatest heroes. The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace is a really special document to me. I think I teared up a little bit when I first read it. There are many people who do not feel at home where they are physically. Ultimately, what makes the internet beatiful is a collection of connections between the ideas of people.</description>
