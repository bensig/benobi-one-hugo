      <h1>About Benobi</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Curiousity is an art form itself. I&rsquo;ve always been a very curious person. I love to learn about people and I love to learn new tricks. My main interests are: internet philosophy, blockchain, building consumer apps, linux \ web security, air quality, dogs, chess, and astrology.</p>
<p>Before going full-force into tech products in 2017, I ran a technology consulting company that I started back in college. The consulting company took me on many adventures and introduced me to many great people - it&rsquo;s still profitable and being run by my business partner today! Now, I work at a VC-backed startup that also raised money through an ICO.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that privacy is a natural right of humans. I don&rsquo;t personally have much to hide, but it seems to me that hiding our patterns makes us less predictable and less easily controlled. I had a dream that it is my mission in life to protect the internet - it gets to be free, safe, and fun.</p>
<p>The biggest thrill for me is strategy planning, but also working with a team of people who are passionate and brilliant - and who are always asking &ldquo;what more can I do?&rdquo; Startups require a special breed of person who is a unicorn in and of themselves - real rockstars of life. It&rsquo;s pretty magical when I find people that are able to work at the same level of intensity and interest that I can bring to a team.</p>
<p>Growing up, my dad was a CEO of a few companies&hellip; I  used to laugh that he ran our household like a business - for example, I got paid for completing individual chores. Bob is also a marketing and merchandising genius. I&rsquo;m always impressed by the way he really understands consumers and products in general. My mom challenged me to think about what I could do for other people. She always asks (rhetorically) &ldquo;What are we here for? To help people, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo; I would say that a large part of my career has been helping other people.</p>
<p>Business has provided me some amazing adventures, I have lived in NYC, San Francisco, Atlanta (breifly), and Los Angeles. I’ve learned a lot from diversity - I have been to Japan several times for a few weeks each and I really love it there because of how people treat one another with so much respect..</p>
<p>On the personal side, I have 2 dogs and we live on the Venice Canals in Los Angeles. I&rsquo;m a fan of yoga in my bedroom (morning and night) and running to the beach. I love hanging out with new people and learning about their passions as well as their intricacies. I am continually fascinated by how unique everyone is&hellip;</p>
<p>One of my greatest challenges is to replace judgement with curiousity. That&rsquo;s one of the signs of a true jedi ;) - I recommend trying it out. Instead of saying &ldquo;that&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo; - I will ask &ldquo;why did you choose to do it that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three things I plan to work on this year: buying a cabin in the woods, getting more sleep, and the ability to draw things I see.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-the-name">About the name</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Benobi&rdquo; was a nickname given to me by my girlfriend back in 2016 when we were traveling in Japan. Every word and name in Japanese must have a consonant followed by a vowel. This name really stuck. Maybe it is because of my awareness and my calm, zen-like approach to problem solving? Or maybe it&rsquo;s because my friends think I&rsquo;m a giant nerd who is super into Star Wars. (Which, by the way, I am moderately into - but not nearly as much as Dustin Boyer or Ashkaan Hassan.) Also, I was doing a lot of self-work during the 2015-2016 time period and it seems to me that any Jedi must first conquer themselves before they can conquer the world.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>
<p>This is a site to showcase some of the things I have been working on for the past few years.</p>
<p>I decided to build it using Hugo since it seemed like something fun and new to learn&hellip; A jedi must always be learning new tricks.</p>
<p>I am planning to use this site to share some of my thoughts about different things I am interested in. If you want to learn more about me check out my <a href="/posts/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
