This is a proof of concept for using &ldquo;wrapped Bitcoin&rdquo; on another blockchain. It&rsquo;s a non-custodial wallet that can work anywhere in the world. Our goal was to build a &ldquo;Venmo-like&rdquo; experience to make Bitcoin really simple to use. The Bitcoin Libre app has no company, no equity, and will be funded and governed as a DAO.

            <p>In honor of the launch of the Bitcoin law in El Salvador, we conceptualized and produced an event in San Salvador. As part of this, we invited 23 local vendors to come and sell their textiles, shirts, jewelry, art, and food - using Bitcoin. We also had a small &ldquo;Banco de Bitcoin&rdquo; where attendees of the event could buy Bitcoin and the vendors could cash out Bitcoin at the end of the night for USD. I also co-authored and designed a drone show of 150 drones telling the story of Bitcoin in El Salvador.</p>

<p>In April of 2017, while traveling in Japan and tracking my cryptocurrency holdings on a spreadsheet - I had an idea to build a better Blockfolio. We came up with the name Squirrel because they always know where their nuts are located. I did not trust the security and privacy features of Blockfolio and I had some ideas on how it could be done better - by enabling the holder to see what holdings they had in which locations. From wireframes to building and launching took about 8 months. The app is available on iOS and Android. Tech stack: (react-native, rails)</p>

Using rapid prototyping and leveraging React Native / Rails - from ideation to launch, the app and website were live in about 90 days. The app successfully pushed us into the center of the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry in Los Angeles. Tech stack: (react, rails)</p>

The motion capture team was facing some data transmission and security challenges on the live production, so they asked me to come down and help out for a few months.

        <div class="portfolio-content">
            <p>The idea of Project LOCAL is to re-brand the label “Made in America” as “Local&quot; to make “Made in America” cool again… This would be a product database / label schema which would add transparency to where the product materials were sourced and where they were assembled.</p>
<p>Eventually, Project Local will create brick and mortar stores that sold US-produced household goods and goodies – like a Target / Wal-Mart store. However, instead of products made in China, Indonesia, Vietnam… These goods would be entirely produced in the US.</p>
<p>I designed and pitched this idea at an LA-startup pitch competition where I won first place. The judges told me that I was &ldquo;cool as a cucumber while pitching&rdquo; which seemed like a great compliment at the time.</p>

            <p>This was the first product I designed back in 2013. Dice was a small camera that could be placed anywhere to produce a &ldquo;portal&rdquo; where other people could watch your video stream in the Dice mobile app (UX visible here on the left). The idea was that you could either have a public or private stream. Users would be able to check on their pets, let people tune into their backyard party, or just use it as a security camera in their garage.</p>
<p>The small form factor of the camera is what made it unique - 3 inches by 3 inches. We had industrial designs, but we did not raise any money to build a prototype.</p>
<p>The designer of this project, Ben Lam, is a dope designer and an old friend. He reached out to let me know that he also has Dice on his <a href="https://www.benlamjunbin.com/dice.html?fbclid=IwAR10l1f7Xp1vBbhwoXieCZvgxCTbzbwxIGCC4QIqyzR3lsr08fifuxHajR0">portfolio here</a>.</p>
