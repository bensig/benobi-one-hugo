      <description>I have been doing some gardening during our COVID-19 quarantine and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how there are similarities between building a product and growing a garden.
My mom loves gardening. One of her favorite movies, &amp;ldquo;Being There&amp;rdquo; is about a simple man &amp;ldquo;Chauncey Gardiner&amp;rdquo; who has spent his entire life in the garden. Since Chauncey has only known the garden his whole life, that is the only way he understands the world.</description>
