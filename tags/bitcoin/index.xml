      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-was-satoshi&#34;&gt;Who was Satoshi?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been a personal fascination of mine since 2012. Who is this mysterious creator of Bitcoin? We can never know for sure, but we can learn a lot about Satoshi by looking at the sources of where they were getting inspiration as well as theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One interesting conclustion reached by my friend and mathematcian Dr. Frederick Krueger (@dotkrueger on Twitter). Fred went through the math of the Bitcoin Whitepaper and verified all of the math proofs recently. His conclusion is that it seems highly likely that Satoshi was someone who either had access to a post-graduate level mathematician, or was one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial sync of your Bitcoin node can take up to a week on a slow CPU and internet connection. Here are some options to speed it up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;option-1---use-this-bitcoin-fast-sync-command&#34;&gt;Option 1 - Use This Bitcoin Fast Sync Command&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no torrent or copy method which would be faster than just using the Bitcoin network &amp;ldquo;hive&amp;rdquo; - which is huge. There may be a way to sync using local or low-latency nodes nearby, but any time you specify which nodes you sync from - it introduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
