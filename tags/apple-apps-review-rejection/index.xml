      <description>There are dozens of reasons you might get rejected by the Apple App Review Team - your metadata might have issues, your screenshots might not have the correct placement of the WiFi or battery symbols, or they might just think your app is boring! I have personally had apps rejected and I have also helped friends navigate app rejections. If your app gets rejected, do not give up! Depending on the reviewer, you might get different results for the same app.</description>
