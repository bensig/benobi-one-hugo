      <title>The Importance of Writing Good Spec Docs</title>

      <description>Writing spec documents is an important aspect of building a product. Even if I am not working with a team, it&amp;rsquo;s very useful as a tool to think through all of my product interactions and explain how they will work. If you cannot explain it very simply, then you will not be able to build it.
In addition, with a team, it&amp;rsquo;s a very useful way to get feedback and &amp;ldquo;buy-in&amp;rdquo; from your team.</description>

      <description>Coming back to the killer apps topic I wrote about last week, I wanted to talk a little bit about what I have learned from friend and mentor of mine, Fred Kreuger. Fred is a CEO and a product guy which is an amazing combination. He has had 9/10 wins for his investors and has run a publicly traded company. Fred earned a PhD in Math from Stanford where he wrote a dissertation titled D-arrangements and Random Polyhedra which later became several classes at Stanford and informed some of the math used in modern cryptography.</description>

      <description>Super thankful today for all of the reviews I have gotten. It looks like I am now up to 52 5 Star reviews on the Apple App Store!!! Big thanks to everyone who downloaded the app and also wrote reviews. I really plan to use that when I speak to my Apple App Store rep this week about Retro Ping. I would really like to find a way to honor everyone who wrote reviews.</description>

      <description>This website has been built with serverless architecture using JAMstack.
The speed of this architecture is really unparalleled. The trick is that I am delivering static content on CDNs.
The entire source code for this site is hosted on GitHub. I have written a previous post about building this site.
Blazing Speed Take a look at the blazing performance of https://benobi.one - the site usually gets a score of 95-100 in terms of speed.</description>

      <title>Rejection is the Beginning of Negotiation</title>

      <description>There are dozens of reasons you might get rejected by the Apple App Review Team - your metadata might have issues, your screenshots might not have the correct placement of the WiFi or battery symbols, or they might just think your app is boring! I have personally had apps rejected and I have also helped friends navigate app rejections. If your app gets rejected, do not give up! Depending on the reviewer, you might get different results for the same app.</description>

      <title>Building a Simple iOS App: Retro Ping App</title>

      <description>I built a mobile app this weekend in Swift. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the end product and I have already tested it out with a few friends.
I wanted to discuss a step-by-step process that I used for building it along with some gotchas and learnings.
Here are the 15 steps I took to create this app:
 Spec Wire Design Code Function Test Functions on Physical Device Code style Test Refine Submit App to Testflight Work on App Store Elements Test App on Testflight (various devices) Refine App Test App Again Submit App to Apple App Review Launch  I knew I wanted to build a simple app with a simple purpose: measure latency and simply say if the connection is &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; based on the latency of the phone.</description>

      <title>Gardening and Building Product</title>

      <description>I have been doing some gardening during our COVID-19 quarantine and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how there are similarities between building a product and growing a garden.
My mom loves gardening. One of her favorite movies, &amp;ldquo;Being There&amp;rdquo; is about a simple man &amp;ldquo;Chauncey Gardiner&amp;rdquo; who has spent his entire life in the garden. Since Chauncey has only known the garden his whole life, that is the only way he understands the world.</description>

      <description>Protecting developers from an increasing scope of work before the initial agreed-upon work is completed is one of the skills of a good tech lead / project developer.
Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a complicated isuse in a way because ideation can be the ultimate creator and killer of products.

      <description>Bye StackOverflow Gone are the days of Stack Overflow; long live YouTube coding tutorials. My Dad used to have a library of home improvement books. It was a set of over 40 color coded books covering every topic from plumbing to roofing to electrical. The books were not that easy to follow either&amp;hellip; diagrams are often not as good as seeing someone do whatever it is you are trying to do in a video.</description>

      <description>This site is built on Hugo which is really fast and easy to work with - even if you are only a basic developer. Here is how I setup my Hugo deployments. It&amp;rsquo;s actually really simple and it will help you save a lot of time updating your site.
Setup vscode to play nicely with Hugo These will help you to see your syntax and build your site from vscode directly using the command pallete.</description>

      <description>In consumer tech products, the holy grail is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;killer app.&amp;rdquo; Of course, in this phrase &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; means that an app will break the mold and have hockey-stick levels of adoption and user activity. This leads many to ponder the question&amp;hellip;
What is the formula for a killer app? Well, there is a man who wrote a formula. I am grateful to have spent some time with Eyal Herzog over the past two years.</description>

      <description>Thank you for visiting. This is my first post. I belive that we should always begin new things with gratitude.
I am grateful for all of the various experiences I have had and the many apps and projects I have worked on since 2013. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe the project list here covers only 7 years!
I am grateful for this site and domain which my dear friend Crystal Rose inspired me to put together.</description>
