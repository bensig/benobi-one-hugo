      <description>I have been doing some gardening during our COVID-19 quarantine and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how there are similarities between building a product and growing a garden.
My mom loves gardening. One of her favorite movies, &amp;ldquo;Being There&amp;rdquo; is about a simple man &amp;ldquo;Chauncey Gardiner&amp;rdquo; who has spent his entire life in the garden. Since Chauncey has only known the garden his whole life, that is the only way he understands the world.</description>

      <description>Protecting developers from an increasing scope of work before the initial agreed-upon work is completed is one of the skills of a good tech lead / project developer.
Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a complicated isuse in a way because ideation can be the ultimate creator and killer of products.

      <description>Bye StackOverflow Gone are the days of Stack Overflow; long live YouTube coding tutorials. My Dad used to have a library of home improvement books. It was a set of over 40 color coded books covering every topic from plumbing to roofing to electrical. The books were not that easy to follow either&amp;hellip; diagrams are often not as good as seeing someone do whatever it is you are trying to do in a video.</description>

      <description>In consumer tech products, the holy grail is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;killer app.&amp;rdquo; Of course, in this phrase &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; means that an app will break the mold and have hockey-stick levels of adoption and user activity. This leads many to ponder the question&amp;hellip;
What is the formula for a killer app? Well, there is a man who wrote a formula. I am grateful to have spent some time with Eyal Herzog over the past two years.</description>

      <description>Thank you for visiting. This is my first post. I belive that we should always begin new things with gratitude.
I am grateful for all of the various experiences I have had and the many apps and projects I have worked on since 2013. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe the project list here covers only 7 years!
I am grateful for this site and domain which my dear friend Crystal Rose inspired me to put together.</description>
