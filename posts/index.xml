      <description>Bye StackOverflow Gone are the days of Stack Overflow; long live YouTube coding tutorials. My Dad used to have a library of home improvement books. It was a set of over 40 color coded books covering every topic from plumbing to roofing to electrical. The books were not that easy to follow either&amp;hellip; diagrams are often not as good as seeing someone do whatever it is you are trying to do in a video.</description>

      <description>In consumer tech products, the holy grail is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;killer app.&amp;rdquo; Of course, in this phrase &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; means that an app will break the mold and have hockey-stick levels of adoption and user activity. This leads many to ponder the question&amp;hellip;

      <description>Thank you for visiting. This is my first post. I belive that we should always begin new things with gratitude.
I am grateful for all of the various experiences I have had and the many apps and projects I have worked on since 2013. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe the project list here covers only 7 years!
I am grateful for this site and domain which my dear friend Crystal Rose inspired me to put together.</description>
